# poppy-emoji-proposal
A proposal to the Unicode Consortium regarding the inclusion of a poppy emoji. The submission has been sent to Unicode and is awaiting review (probably sometime in 2019), but feel free to discuss anything in the Issues section of this GitHub repository.

## Status

**Update 21/11/2018:** The proposal has hit a snag, I need to redo the search results to show `poppy`. Also a more represensative graphic will be needed as apparently the current graphic is too similar to the hibiscus emoji (even though the hibiscus depiction in all Emoji artwork shown on the [Unicode Consortium's chart](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#plant-flower) are pink while the proposed poppy is red).

The current status of the proposal is that it has been sent to the Emoji subcommittee and is awaiting feedback from them regarding whether the proposal is well-written and meets the criteria outlined by the Unicode Consortium.

If the Emoji subcommittee verifies that it is a good proposal, the proposal will be forwarded to the Unicode Consortium which will then be rejected as ineligible, given feedback to improve the proposal, or accepted as-is and will be added to presumably the 2020 Emoji standard (according to the Unicode Consortium is the deadline for the 2019 Emoji standard was 31st March 2018).

The Unicode Consortium have acknowledged the proposal and have catalogued the poppy in the [Emoji Requests](https://unicode.org/emoji/emoji-requests.html) section of their website. Under *New* which means *"A proposal was received, and it is on the agenda for an upcoming meeting.".*

## Background

The Remembrance Poppy is a well known symbol here in the UK and in other Commonwealth countries. Every year on the 11th November at 11:00am, many take a silence in memory of those lost in conflicts both in the past and in the present day.

The poppy is everywhere, so naturally as an important symbol I was surprised to realise that the *Papaver rhoeas* flower is not represented in the Unicode standard. Then as I googled around, I noticed I wasn't the only one would wanted to use it.

So I started a proposal and when I reached a point when I thought it was ready to submit I sent it. However, in case of rejection (where I may need some ideas from the community) and for archival purposes I have uploaded the proposal to GitHub.
